Of course. I've updated the `README.md` to only include instructions for `npm`.

# Uncertainty Analysis Application

This is a standalone React application designed for uncertainty analysis, risk analysis, and specification comparison. It provides a professional and intuitive interface for metrology and engineering professionals.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

  * **Node.js**: This project requires Node.js to run. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
  * **npm**: The Node Package Manager is included with the Node.js installation.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```sh
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies**:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application in development mode:

```sh
npm start
```

This will run the app in development mode and open it in your default browser at [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000). The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console. **WE WILL UPDATE THIS LATER -> COULD BE HOSTED ON NEW NPSL RAN DOMAIN**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

  * `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.
  * `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
  * `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
  * `npm run eject`: **Note**: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back\!
